Introduction
Section for showcasing API endpoints

​
Get Started
Headless API is an e-commerce development method where the user interface (Frontend) is separated from the product management and transaction processing systems (Backend). In headless commerce, the front-end can be built using various modern web technologies such as React or Vue.js, while the back-end performs tasks such as product storage, order processing, and integration with payment systems.
By separating the front-end and back-end, headless commerce allows development teams to focus on the user experience without being hampered by the limitations of the underlying e-commerce platform. It also helps reduce the cost and time required to update and maintain an e-commerce site.
​
Authentication
For starting using Mayar Headless API, you need account at https://mayar.id. If you have an account, you can create API KEY from https://web.mayar.id/api-keys.
Generate API Key
For your account security, don’t share your API KEY!
Please note that any changes to your domain or subdomain require you to create a new API KEY, so the link in the response you receive will also be updated.
​
Sandbox Environment
For testing purposes, you can use the webpage https://web.mayar.club/. You can log in or register first, then generate an API key from https://web.mayar.club/api-keys. (The same method as obtaining an API key on the production page).
​
Base URL
The API Base URL is the main part of the address (URL) used to access an API endpoint. Mayar has two API Base URL’s based on the page.

API documentation
Status Code
Status Code From API Endpoint Request Results.

The status code on an API endpoint is a 3-digit numeric code returned by the server each time a client (such as a browser, application, or other backend) sends a request to the API. Every request in our API has a response, and each response has a status code. This code indicates whether the request was successful, failed, or encountered another issue.
Status Code	Explanation
200	Your request Success
400	Bad request, your request in complate or you need add required data
404	Endpoint or Product doesn’t exist.
401	You dont have Authorization for access API
429	Your limit reached
500	Error

API Rate Limit
API Rate limit per minute

Mayar API rate limits and best practices for handling them.
Mayar API has rate limits to ensure fair usage and maintain performance. The limits are as follows:
20 requests per minute per IP address.
If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a 429 Too Many Requests response. The response will include a **Retry-After **header indicating how long you should wait before making another request.
